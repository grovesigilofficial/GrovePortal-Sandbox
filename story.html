<p>★ MY AWAKENING ★</p>

<p>I didn’t plan any of it. One night when I was eighteen, I took something my friends called “sassafras,” and I believed them...</p>

<p>The table started breathing. Textures moved like the world was made of soft waves. The room felt alive in a way I didn’t have words for.</p>

<p>I wasn’t spiritual yet. I didn’t know meditation, ego death, chakras, none of it...</p>

<p>And then came the breakup. Hard. Sudden. Like someone knocked the last support beam out from under me...</p>
